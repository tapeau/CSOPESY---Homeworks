# Week 05 Homework - Immediate-mode mockup: the marquee console
This homework is an implementation of a "marquee" console application â€” a command-line application for our class that displays a moving string across the CLI while enabling the user to input any command through constant keyboard polling, both set to some fixed refresh rate and polling rate.

## Running the program
Simply compile and build both the `non_threaded.cpp` and the `threaded.cpp` files, and run the resulting executable files `non_threaded.exe` and `threaded.exe` through a CLI instance with these commands:
```
.\non_threaded
.\threaded
```
